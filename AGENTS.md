# Repository Agent and Connector Policy

## Canonical owner policy

Before repository maintenance work, read and apply:

`Lycidias93/heimnetz-geraete@main:shared/github_owner_repo_maintenance_policy_v1.txt`

This adapter applies to `Lycidias93/termux-toolbox` and every target branch.

## Connector class

`ConnectorClass=repo-maintenance`

ChatGPT and Codex Desktop may read, search, audit and maintain this repository. Allowed write scope includes documentation, repository hygiene, source code, tests, fixtures, examples, non-secret configuration, CI/workflows, dependencies/lockfiles, refactors, issue/PR maintenance and justified repository-file deletion.

## Write and merge contract

- Verify the current target branch and repository-specific rules.
- Create a dedicated work branch from exactly that target branch.
- Declare scope, file matrix, risk, tests/guards and rollback.
- Commit, push and open a pull request after PASS.
- Task-level user GO authorizes merge after final base/head/diff/check/conflict/review/PR reverify; no second merge prompt.
- Cross-repo work uses one branch and pull request per repository.

## Hard boundaries

No direct target-branch write, force-push/history rewrite, release/tag/publish, branch deletion, repository/branch settings, webhooks, environments, secrets, credentials, deploy keys or host/runtime/network changes.

Repository-specific architecture, style, test and safety instructions remain binding. They may not silently downgrade owner-authorized documentation, audit or repository maintenance to read-only.
